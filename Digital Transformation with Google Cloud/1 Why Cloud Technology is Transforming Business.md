# Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business

[toc]

## Innovations, paradigm shifts, and digital transformations

- innovations comes in waves from breakthrough technology
- the entire industrial revolution resulted from new technologies that came together and facilitated new ways of working
- electricity, light bulbs, household appliances, computers are all **paradigm shifts**
  - a fundamental and irreversible change in the way humans engage with the world
- **digital transformation** is a current paradigm shift
  - when an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify business processes to meet the needs of changing business and marketing dynamics
  - [IDC](https://www.idc.com/) predicts 50% of all IT spending will go towards digital transformation by 2024

## What is the cloud?

- the cloud is a metaphor for the network of datacenters that store and analyze data availabe through the internet
- business can implement their IT infulstructure on the cloud with
  1. on-premises
  2. private cloud
  3. public cloud
  4. hybrid cloud
  5. multi cloud

### 1 On Premisies (on-prem)

#### Pros

- hosted on-site
- located and operated in an organization's data center
- traditonal way of managing IT infrastructure
- doesn't require 3rd party access 
- owners have physical control
- no payment for ongoing access

#### Con

Business must buy their own servers and infrastructure which needs

- physical space
- specialized rooms (like for cooling)
- expert personnel
- difficult to scale
- more computing resources than is actually needed (high overhead)

### 2 Private Cloud

- dedicated to a single organizationan
- a.k.a. *single-tenant* or *corporate cloud*
- organizations will usually have to do the same mainatance for a private cloud as on-prem
- usually hosted in 
  - 3rd party co-location facility
  - own data center
  - private cloud provider
- organizations will do this because
  - they already made investments in their own infrastructure
  - regulatory reasons

### 3 Public Cloud

- computing services and infrastructure are provided with 3rd parties like Google Cloud
- shared with multiple organizations (tenants) over the internet
- a.k.a.*multi-tenant cloud infrastructure*
- each tenants' data is hidden from others
- usually "cloud" refers to public cloud

#### Pros

- on-demand availabity
- no need to manage or configure resources
- pay for what you use

#### 3 types of services models

1. IaaS or *infrastructure as service*
2. PaaS or *platform as a service*
3. SaaS or *software as a service*

### 4 Hybrid cloud or Multi cloud

- though they're not the same, they're used interchangeably
- in a **hybrid clouds**, apps run in a combination of different environments
  - like using an on-prem alongside Google Cloud
- **multi cloud** is when organizations use multiple public cloud environments
  - most organizations use hybrid or multi cloud environments

## Benefits of the Cloud

### Scalable

- its scalable
- latest technologies on demand
- accelerate deployment time

### Flexible

- access anywhere with internet
- scale services up / down

### Agile

- develop new applications
- rapidly get into production
- no infrastructure worries

### Strategic value

- higher return on investment
- innovate and try new ideas faster

### Security

- stronger than enterprise data centers
- depth and breadth of mechanisms
- dedicated teams

### Cost Effective

- pay for what is used
- no overbuilding data centers

## Importance of Embracing new technology

- successful companies should focus on *why* they exist and not *how*
- Nintendo kept using new technology as it came and directed their focus on why they exist which is for play
- new technology is not a threat but an opportunity
  - digital transformation is an ongoing process

## Challenges that lead to a digital transformation

Biggest challenges to accelerate digital include

1. business want to be the best at understanding using data
2. want the best technology infrastructure
3. want to create the best hybrid workplace
4. want to know their data, systems, and users are secure
5. prioritize sustainability

## Google’s Transformation Cloud

5 capabilities that form the basis of the transformation cloud

1. data
2. open infrastructure
3. collaboration
4. trust
5. sustainable technology

### Data

- needed to actually use data
- only 26% of companies have succeeded in creating a data-driven organization
- **data clouds** let organizations identify and process data with great 
  - scale
  - speed
  - security
  - reliability

### Open infrastructure

#### Open standard

- software with particular specifications
- accessible and usable by anyone
- because the specifications are open, it stops vendor lock-in
- for example,
  - XML format
  - HTTP requests

#### Open source

- source code is pubic, free to use and modify
- created through public collaboration

Open source plays a critical role in open cloud to deliver customers the portability they expect. For example, Google was behind

- Kubernetes (today's standard for containers in the cloud)
- TensorFlow (train AI models)

### Collaboration

- "hybrid work is here to stay"
- Google Workspace offers a collaboration cloud which includes Google Docs, Meets, etc...

### Sustainable technology

- Google Cloud saves carbon emissions ❤️
