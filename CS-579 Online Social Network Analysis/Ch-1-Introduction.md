# Introduction

- **Social Media** is the use of electronic and Internet tools for the purpose of sharing and discussing information and experiences with other human beings in more efficient ways
- **Social Media Mining** is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from social media data

#### Social Media Mining Problems

##### Big Data Paradox

- Social media data is big, yet not evenly distributed.
- Often little data is available for an individual
- most users donâ€™t post much but just observe other posts

##### Obtaining Sufficient Samples

- Are our samples reliable representatives of the full data?
- users are now very concerned with privacy

##### Noise Removal Fallacy

- Too much removal makes data more sparse
- Noise definition is relative and complicated and is task-dependent

##### Evaluation Dilemma

- When there is no ground truth, how can you evaluate?
