# Divide & Conquer

- let $T(n)$ be the running time on a problem of size $n$
- if the problem size is small enough where $n \le c$ for come constant $c$, the straightforward solution takes constant time $\Theta(1)$
- suppose the *division* of the problem yields $a$ subproblems each of which is $1/b$ size of the original such that it takes $aT(\frac nb)$ to solve the $a$ subproblems
- suppose the division itself is $D(n)$
- and the *conquering* (combining subproblems) takes $D(n)$
- we then get the general form of the recurrence:

$$
T(n) = 
\begin{cases}
\Theta(1) & \text{if } n\le c \\
aT(\frac nb) +D(n) + C(n) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
