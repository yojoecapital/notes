# Duplicates, Modifications, and Secondary Indexes

[toc]

## Duplicate Keys

- ==primary index== an index associated with a sorted file where the search key is *unique*
- in some cases, databases allow for duplicate values in search keys
  - this requires indices that can handle duplicates efficiently
- to implement such an index we can use
  - **dense index** with 1 index field
    - per record (pointer to each duplicate)
    - per unique search key (pointer to only first record)
  - **sparse index** 

### Duplicate Search Keys with Dense Index

<img src="images/image-20231107164835692.png" alt="image-20231107164835692" style="zoom:50%;" />

- <span style="color:MediumSpringGreen">Pros:</span>
  - easy to find & count records
- <span style="color:red">Cons:</span>
  - more fields than necessary

### Duplicate Search Keys with Dense Index keys

- one index field per unique search key

<img src="images/image-20231107164959489.png" alt="image-20231107164959489" style="zoom:50%;" />

- <span style="color:MediumSpringGreen">Pros:</span>
  - smaller index
  - quick search
- <span style="color:red">Cons:</span>
  - more complicated to find successive records
  - to find all data records with search key `K` follow the one pointer in the index and then move forward in the data file

### Duplicate search keys with sparse index

- <span style="color:MediumSpringGreen">Pros:</span>
  - small index
  - fast search
- <span style="color:red">Cons:</span>
  - complicated to find records (i.e. looking for key 30)

## Modifications

- an index file is a sequential file & must be treated in a similar way to a file of sorted records
  - use overflow blocks
  - insert new blocks
  - slide elements to adjacent blocks

### Deletion using Sparse Index

<img src="images/image-20231107223110780.png" alt="image-20231107223110780" style="zoom:50%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107223125211.png" alt="image-20231107223125211" style="zoom:50%;" />

- as a sparse index points to the block, no action is required
  - note that any record that is *not* the index's search key should not result in any action

<img src="images/image-20231107222852454.png" alt="image-20231107222852454" style="zoom:50%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107222901548.png" alt="image-20231107222901548" style="zoom:50%;" />

- the first record of the block was updated so the the index must be updated by just **replacing** it with the next available record

<img src="images/image-20231107223306892.png" alt="image-20231107223306892" style="zoom: 25%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107223316906.png" alt="image-20231107223316906" style="zoom: 33%;" /> →  <img src="images/image-20231107223335621.png" alt="image-20231107223335621" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- in this case, there is no available records left in the block so the block can be removed
  - the subsequent indexes are also shifted up


### Deletion using Dense Index

<img src="images/image-20231107224530601.png" alt="image-20231107224530601" style="zoom: 25%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107224544049.png" alt="image-20231107224544049" style="zoom: 33%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107224619948.png" alt="image-20231107224619948" style="zoom:33%;" />

- this will be similar to record deletion

### Insertion using Sparse Index

<img src="images/image-20231107225032834.png" alt="image-20231107225032834" style="zoom:50%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107225039286.png" alt="image-20231107225039286" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="images/image-20231107225103913.png" alt="image-20231107225103913" style="zoom:50%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107225222643.png" alt="image-20231107225222643" style="zoom:50%;" />

- in this example, we checked for space in the next block and slice the data down
  - an alternative would be to use an overflow block to insert 15
  - the alternative is demonstrated below

<img src="images/image-20231107225333508.png" alt="image-20231107225333508" style="zoom: 33%;" /> → <img src="images/image-20231107225343918.png" alt="image-20231107225343918" style="zoom:50%;" />

- this is also what would occur if there is no room in the next block

## Sparse vs. Dense Tradeoff

|               | Dense                                         | Sparse                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| space         | 1 index field per record (many)               | 1 index filed per block (few)                      |
| access        | direct access to record                       | must search block                                  |
| exist queries | only needs index                              | must search block                                  |
| modifications | always updated if the order of records change | updated *only* if first record of block is changed |

## Secondary Indexes

- ==secondary index== additional indexes created on attributes other than primary key
  - they provide alternative paths to data
- work on unsorted records
- works like any other index (find record faster)
- first level is always dense; any other levels are sparse
- duplicates are allowed

#### Secondary Indexes: Dense vs Sparse

- the records would typically be sorted by the primary key
- the secondary index would be sorted by its own search-key such that it will have a different order from the sequential order of the records file

<img src="images/image-20231107230740330.png" alt="image-20231107230740330" style="zoom:50%;" /> <img src="images/image-20231107230941034.png" alt="image-20231107230941034" style="zoom:50%;" />

- because the order of the index file is different from the data file, we can't have sparse indexes as they won't make sense to search
  - thus, the first level of secondary indexes are always dense
    - i.e. pointers are record pointers
  - any [other levels on top of the first](5.1-Conventional-Indexes.md#Multilevel Index) should be sparse

#### Secondary Index and Duplicate Keys

<img src="images/image-20231107231132426.png" alt="image-20231107231132426" style="zoom:50%;" />

- duplicate keys can introduce a lot of overhead
- altenatives:
  - [Variable sized index fields](#Variable sized index fields)
  - [Chain records](#Chain records)
  - [Buckets](#Buckets)

##### Variable sized index fields

- another option is to have **variable sized index fields**

<img src="images/image-20231107231216022.png" alt="image-20231107231216022" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- <span style="color:MediumSpringGreen">Pros:</span>
  - saves space in index
- <span style="color:crimson">Cons:</span>
  - requires more complex data structures to efficiently locate and manipulate index entries  

##### Chain records

- another option is to **chain records with same key**
  - the index entry points to first record of matching key
  - records with same key are linked together in linked list structure

<img src="images/image-20231107231558102.png" alt="image-20231107231558102" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- <span style="color:MediumSpringGreen">Pros:</span>
  - simple index 
  - easy to search
- <span style="color:crimson">Cons:</span> 
  - add fields to records header
  - must follow chain to successive records

##### Buckets

- instead of directly pointing to records with same search-key value, the index entry points to a ==bucket==
  - buckets are intermediate data structures placed between the *secondary index file* and *data file*
- each index record now points to a specific bucket that contains pointers to all actual records with same search-key value

<img src="images/image-20231107232044252.png" alt="image-20231107232044252" style="zoom:50%;" />

###### Why "bucket" idea is useful?

- consider relation `Emp(name, dept, floor)`
- suppose we have a *primary index* on `name` and *secondary indexes & indirect buckets* with `dept` and `floor`

```sql
SELECT name FROM Emp
WHERE dept = 'Toy' AND floor = 2;
```

<img src="images/image-20231107232444088.png" alt="image-20231107232444088" style="zoom:50%;" />

- to get the result, look for the intersection of the `Toy dept` bucket and the `floor 2` bucket
  - this minimizes the disk I/O

## Conventional Index Issues

- **unbalanced performance** with the number of operations to find a record varying based on data
- **degrading performance** as the file grows (due to overflow blocks)
- need for periodic reorganization of entire file
- *B^+^-Tree indexes are a more efficient alternative*
  - they also have disadvantages however
