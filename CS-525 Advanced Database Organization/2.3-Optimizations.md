# Optimizations

[toc]

- effective ways to speed up disk accesses:
  - disk scheduling algorithms
  - track (or larger) buffer
  - pre-fetch (a.k.a. double buffering)
  - on disk cache

## Disk Scheduling

- the disk controller can order the requests to minimize seeks
- ==service policy== in what order should the disk controller process the requests?
  - **Na√Øve service**: first come first serve
    - fairness but inefficient (zig-zag read patterns as the head goes up and down the tracks)
  - common **Elevator algorithm**
    - the disk head sweeps in-and-out (like an elevator)
    - when the disk head is on cylinder $k$, the disk will service all requests for that cylinder before moving to the next cylinder 
    - this is efficient though unfair

## Pre-fetching (Double Buffer)

- in some scenarios, we can predict the order in which blocks will be requested from disk by some process
- ==pre-fetching== is the method of fetching the necessary block into the buffer in advance
- requires enough buffer space
- speedup factor is up to $n$ where $n$ is the number of blocks requested by a process

### Pre-fetching Example

- assume a process will request blocks $B_1,B_2,B_3,...$
- let $P$ be the time to process a block
  - $R$ is the time time to read a block
  - $n$ is number of blocks
- for a single buffer solution, the time to process $n$ blocks is
  - read $B_1$ to buffer ($R$)
  - process $B_1$ in buffer ($P$)
  - for each block...
  - $n(P+R)$
- for a double buffer solution, while the program process the data, the second buffer is used to pre-fetch the next block
  - $R + nP$
