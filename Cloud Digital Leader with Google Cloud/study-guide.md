# Study Guide

- **digital transformation**: paradigm shift; when an organization uses new digital technologies to create or modify business processes to meet the needs of changing business and marketing dynamics'
- **cloud**: metaphor for the network of data centers that store and analyze data through internet
- **on-prem**: hosted on site; runs in a locally environment
- **private cloud**: cloud resource dedicated to a single organization; accessed through the internet
  - used when already made infrastructure investments 
  - or regulatory reasons
- **public cloud**: computing services and infrastructure are provided with 3rd parties like Google Cloud
- **hybrid cloud**: combination of different environments (like on-prem & public cloud)
- **multi cloud**: multiple public cloud environments
- **open standard**: software with particular specifications
  - stops vendor lock-in
  - example) ML, HTTP
- **open source**: source code is public, free to use & modify
  - example) Google was behind Kubernetes & TensorFlow
- **total cost of ownership (TCO)**: for on-prem, TCO is associated with the cost of static resources throughout their lifetime
  - the cost of on-prem is dominated by the initial cost of hardware and software
  - but cloud computing is a payed-per-use model
- **CapEx**: *upfront* business expenses put toward fixed assets
- **OpEx**: *recurring* costs for more immediate benefit
- **IP address**: identify a network or the location of a particular device on a network
- **domain name**: easy to remember name that maps to an IP address
- **domain name system (DNS)**: DNS server stores a database of domain names mapped to IP addresses that can be used by computers to communicate with each other
- **bandwidth**: how much data a network can transfer over time; i.e. *width of a pipe*
- **latency**: time it takes for data to travel from one point to another; i.e. *twists and turns in pipe*
- **geographic location** is divided into
  - **regions** which are divided into
  - **zones**; where Google Cloud's resources deployed 
- **network's edge**: where a device or network connects to the internet
- **infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**: offers on-demaind availability of almost infinitely scalable resources
  - such as compute, networking, storage, databases
  - lease resources and only pay for what you use
  - main reasons organizations use IaaS to shift from CapEx to OpEx
  - example) Compute Engine for VMs, Cloud Storage
  - why) highly flexible, maintain control over infrastructure
- **platform as a service (PaaS)**: provides a platform for developers to develop, run, and manage their own applications
  - can use built-in software components
  - reduces the amount of code they need to write
  - example) Cloud Run (server-less platform), BigQuery
  - why) building software products
- **software as a service (SaaS)**: a computing model that offers an entire application offered by a cloud provider through a web browser
  - example) Gmail, Drive, Meet, etc...
  - why) ready to use
- **shared responsibility model**: provider is responsible for security *of* cloud; customer is responsible for security *in* cloud
  - if you configure or store it, you're responsible for securing it.
- **structured data**: highly organized & well defined
  - in a table
- **semi-structured data**: organized in a hierarchy; no formal structure; has tags
  - example) email, HTML, JSON, XML
- **unstructured data**: text, images, audio, video
- **database** is an organized collection of data stored electronically.
- **relational database**: has clearly defined schema's
  - relationships
  - SQL to query
- **non-relational database (no-SQL)**: non-tabular
  - flexible data model
  - ideal for data with changing organization
- **data warehouse**: enterprise system used for analysis and reporting of structured and semi structured data from multiple sources
  - example) BigQuery
- **data lake**: repository designed to ingest, store, explore, process, and analyze any type of volume of *raw data*
  - unlike the clean data in data warehouses
- **first-party data**: proprietary customer datasets
- **second-party data**: first-party data from another organization that can easily be deployed to augment a company's internal datasets
- **third-party data**: datasets collected and managed by organizations that don't directly interact with an organization's business
  - often shared on marketplaces like the Google Cloud Marketplace
- data life cycle
  1. **data genesis**: initial creation of a unit of data
  2. **data collection**: data ingested into new system
  3. **data processing**: data is adjusted such as merging datasets together
  4. **data storage**: where the data stores and is ready for analysis and action
     - example) no-SQL, data warehouse, object storage
  5. **data analysis**: provides direction for business oriented action
  6. **data activation**: when an analysis is made, it needs to be pushed to the relevant decision makers
- **data governance**: setting internal standards for how data is managed
  - granting access permissions; complying with external standards
- **object storage**: data storage architecture that manages data as “objects”
  - unstructured data 
  - uses globally unique identifier in the form of URLs making it easy to integrate with web technologies
- **Cloud Storage**: allows customers to store any amount of data 
  - **Standard**: good for hot data or stored for brief time
  - **Nearline**: ~once a month
  - **Coldline**: ~every 90 days
  - **Archive**: ~less than once a year
  - **Autoclass**: 
    - a features that moves data not accessed to colder storage classes to reduce storage cost
    - moves data that is accessed to standard storage to optimize future access
- **Cloud SQL**: fully managed relation databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server
  - **database migration service (DMS)**: makes it easy to migrate production databases to Cloud SQL with minimum down time
- **Cloud Spanner**: relational database service that is *mission critical* & *scales horizontal*
- use *Spanner* if
  - have outgrown any relational database
  - are sharding your databases (storing a large database across multiple machines) for throughput high performance
  - need transactional consistency
- use *Cloud SQL* if
  - don't need horizontal scalng
  - don't need globally available system
