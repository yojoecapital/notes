# The Value of Data

## [How data creates value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6UKQbNLz-M)

- the most valuable insights no longer come from just sales, inventory, and personnel data
- they're often hidden in unstructured data points across different systems
- 68% of organizations are unable to realize tangible and measurable value from data

Data can be categorized in 3 ways.

### Structured data

- highly organized & well defined
- usually stored in a table
- examples include table or database
- easy to analyze

### Semi-structured data

- organized in a hierarchy
- without full differentiation or order
- examples include emails, HTML, JSON, XML
- doesn't have a formal structure
- contains tags for easier analysis

### Unstructured data

- examples include
  - text like documents
  - data files like images, audio, video
  - infrastructure activity and performance data
- represents 80 to 90% of all enterprise data
- difficult to analyze but cloud technology gives tools to make it possible such as with APIs
  - i.e. Google Cloud Vision APIs to get product data from an image

## [Data management concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nThMEdgYUBA)

A **database** is an organized collection of data stored electronically.

### Relational database

- stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
- has clearly defined schema's
- can establish links (i.e. relationships) by joining tables
- SQL can query and manipulate data
- best for large amount of structured data

### Non-relational database (NoSQL)

- doesn't use tabular format
- follow a flexible data model
- ideal for data with changing organization
- ideal for applications with diverse data types

### Data warehouse

- a **data warehouse** is an enterprise system used for analysis and reporting of structured and semi structured data from multiple sources
- can help analyze sales and identify trends
- not typically the answer for unstructured data
- Google Cloudâ€™s modern and serverless data warehousing solution is **BigQuery**
- users include 
  - business intelligence analysts
- the goal is to 
  - use the data to answer questions

### Data lake

- a repository designed to ingest, store, explore, process, and analyze any type of volume of *raw data*
- unlike the clean data in data warehouses
- users include 
  - business intelligence analysts
  - data engineers
  - data scientists
- the goal is to
  - explore, mine, and experiment with raw data

### First-party data

- the proprietary customer datasets that a business collects from customer transactions and interactions

### Second-party data

- first-party data from another organization that can easily be deployed to augment a company's internal datasets
- organizations don't directly own this data but it's relevant to their business 

### Third-party data

- datasets collected and managed by organizations that don't directly interact with an organization's business
- these can come from government, nonprofit, academic sources, or analyst reports
- often shared on marketplaces like the Google Cloud Marketplace

Imagine data going down an assembly line. The line adds parts and value to the data as it goes down. Eventually it turns into actions we can take.

### Data genesis

- initial creation of a unit of data
- for example, a swipe of a credit card or a sensory device

### Data collection

- data is ingested into a new system

### Data processing

- data is adjusted such as merging datasets together

### Data storage

- where the data stores and is ready for analysis and action
- different types of data can be stored in different ways
  - NoSQL for fast reads and writes
  - data warehousing for fast access to analysis
  - object storage for unstructured data

### Data analysis

- provides direction for business oriented action

### Data activation

- when an analysis is made, it needs to be pushed to the relevant decision makers

## [Data governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m27rFmBegAA)

- setting internal standards for how data is managed
- granting access permissions
- complying with external standards
- without an effective data governance program, businesses will suffer
  - fines
  - poor data quality
  - challenges in finding data
  - poorly trained data models for AI
