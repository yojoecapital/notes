# Google Cloudâ€™s AI and ML Solutions

## [BigQuery ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8_HQhNxjoI)

- BigQuery ML democratizes the use of machine learning by empowering data analysts, but primary data warehouse users, to build and run models by using existing business intelligence tools and spreadsheets
- programming Python and Java solutions is not required
  - models can be trained directly using SQL
- "brings ML to the data"
- also integrates with **Vertex AI**, Google Cloud's end-to-end AI and ML platform

## [Pre-trained APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyW2jEF3Cmo)

- great option If you don't have your own training data
- good for organizations that don't have specialized data scientists but have business analysts and developers
- fastest and lowest cost of ML approaches but is less customizable 
- Google Cloud's pre-trained APIs can help developers build smart apps quickly by providing access to ML models for common tasks like analyzing images, videos, and text

## [AutoML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_oUAw19XV8)

- **Vertex AI** brings together Google Cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface
- you can use your own training data with Vertex AI to manage and build ML projects
- **AutoML** in Vertex AI lets you train your own models using a GUIs without code
- for example, 
  - Google Cloud has a vision *pre-trained API* that can do tasks like distinguish between car parts
  - but it can't distinguish between a good and broken part
  - a developer can use AutoML Vision to train a model using your specialized data

## [Custom models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBdOD-HErSE)

- Vertex AI is also the essential platform for creating custom end-to-end machine learning models
- this process takes the longest and requires a specialized team of data scientists and engineers

## [TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRlV9yk9a-8)

- all ML models are built on top of Google Cloud's AI foundational infrastructure
- part of this foundation is **TensorFlow** (TF)
  - end-to-end open source platform for ML
- TF takes advantage of **Tensor Processing Unit** (TPU)
  - Google's custom developed application specific certitude to accelerate ML workloads
  - this is an example of *domain-specific hardware* as opposed to *general-purpose* like GPUs or CPUs
- with TPUs, the computing speed increases up to 200 times

- **Contact Center AI** provides models for speaking with customers 
- **Document AI** classifies information from unstructured documents such as invoices, receipts
- **Discovery AI** for retail uses ML to select the optimal ordering of products on a retailer's e-commerce site
- **Cloud Talent Solution** uses AI with job search and talent acquisition capabilities
